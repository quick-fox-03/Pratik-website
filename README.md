# Pratik-website
This is a repository containing the files and assets of my personal website.

Using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap, I created a modern looking personal website that lists my skills, hobbies and passions. The website contains several pages, one for the home page, one for contact details and one page about me.
This is not a final design yet, and I aim to improve it over time.
